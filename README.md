# DRL-PG-reinforce

## Description

In this repo I train an agent using the reinforce algorithm in which I use two traces to estimate the graident of the policy. The agent was trained and tested over the enviroment CartPole-v0 from OpenAI-GYM.

## Usage

The RL algorithm is located under jupyter notebook **REINFORCE.ipynb** in which you can train the agent from scratch using the default params or testing it with diferent configs.

## Installation

To use this code you need to install the following packages:

* gym
* torch
* numpy
* jupiyter
* matplotlib
